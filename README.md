# Hi, I'm Victor 👋

### 16-yo Aspiring Developer | Python & Web Enthusiast

I am a results-oriented developer focused on building clean and efficient code. I enjoy solving logical problems and creating tools that make life easier. Currently mastering modern software architecture and building functional web applications.

### 🪪My Path

I started learning programming from YouTube videos after I chose to write a program for a school project. After that, I became very interested in coding and in the near future I plan to make my first mods for Minecraft and games. Although I have already made clicker-type games based on Godot, I want to make something more serious and upload it to Steam.
